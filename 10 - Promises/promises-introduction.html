  // NOTE: Bottom line: "Promises allow us the synchronous way of writing code while giving us asynchronous execution of code.", from https://www.telerik.com/blogs/what-is-the-point-of-promises
  // NOTE: JavaScript, which is single-threaded (but can offload work to multiple threads through Web Workers), will move through its call stack one item at a time (synchronous). JavaScript broswers I/O is also largely non-blocking (asynchronous), so setTimeout, Promises, etc., will all come back up to the top of the stack when they're relevant (resolved, timed out, etc.)
  console.log('#1 going to fetch')
  const postsPromise = fetch('http://wesbos.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts');
  console.log('#2 have called fetch')
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(`#4 the delayed result of fetch, which returns a promise: ${postsPromise}`)
  }, 3000)
  console.log(`#3 the result of fetch, which returns a promise: ${postsPromise}`)

  // NOTE: I can think of .then() as a success event listener on the Promise; .catch() as a failure event listener.
  // Also, you're going to be using .json() alot.
